      ##### **Weather and What to Wear**

      **Dry Season:** February to May.


      **Rainy Season:** October to December.


      **June, July, August, September:** Sunny mornings, changing skies in the afternoon with mist hanging on the peaks by mid-afternoon. Late afternoon often sees surrounding thunderstorms, though they rarely directly impact us.


      Nights are most often clear with views of the stars.


      Due to the altitude, the temperature is generally pleasant, tending towards cool. A light fleece jacket is usually sufficient for the evening.


      **Recommended items to pack :**


      Rain jacket


      Light fleece jacket


      Hiking boots


      Sunscreen (the sun is strong even if the temperature is cool)


      ##### **Transportation**

      Due to a steep incline, a 4-wheel drive vehicle is required to navigate the final 800 meters of the road, which is cemented. For all other transportation needs, we will assist with arrangements upon your reservation.


      ##### **Wildlife Encounter**

      While Quetzals can be seen throughout a large part of the year, the months of March, April, and May offer the best chance to observe them (see Blog). Most bird species also nest during this period and are very active.


      Our farm is abundant with plants and flowers favored by hummingbirds, making our gardens a paradise for observing them, as well as nests and chicks of many species.


      Observing a jaguar, mountain lion, or other large predator is possible but remains very rare. Please do not visit specifically for this purpose, although their presence is confirmed by the tracks they leave.
