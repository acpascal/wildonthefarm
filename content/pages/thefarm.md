      On 42 acres, at the edge of the Amistad national park and open to a magnificent view, this paradise which unites the earth and the sky is a haven of freshness offered by an exceptional microclimate. Here, silence leads to serenity. Wildlife, including the mystical Quetzal, is the cradle of an inner peace which has become the only great luxury of our time.


      Located at 1800 meters (5905ft) elevation with a spring-like temperature year-round, we are fortunate to own a rare high-altitude spring in the national park and enjoy pure water year-round.


      The chalet is a wonderful creation, absolutely unique in Panama, which took us four years to realize in the purest tradition of the "compagnons du devoir" from France. It carries the soul of the hands which built with love inspired by knowledge, and with the respect dedicated to the most beautiful materials. It is built with the most prestigious wood, from an ecological Indian reservation program supervised and certified by the World Wildlife Fund.


      The three cabins are built in Amargo, an extremely hard wood that I have been drying for ten years. Inside, cedar, a softer tropical wood, mahogany, and a Versailles parquet floor, as well as high-end furniture and high-end mattresses.


      The kitchen and the dining room are in an independent building, built mainly from Amargo-amargo, with an Amargo-amargo frame.
      We are completely self-sufficient in electricity thanks to a very efficient new modern solar system.


      We have successfully experimented with 100% organic crops which have brought us to complete autonomy. Thanks to our activity, the soil is black and rich, and with the beneficial microclimate, everything grows. Water by gravity, electricity by the sun, vegetables from the fertile earth. Sheep, goats, hens, and chickens clean and fertilize the orchards, specific plants for healing and fertilizing, producing abundance and health.


      After 16 years experience to establish our farm, we welcome you to stay, regenerate and enjoy the beauty of the most healthy place in Boquete.

      Wild on the Farm was born from a deep journey through Panama’s wildest places. When the founder discovered this untouched land after years of exploration, he saw the perfect setting to create a self-sustaining haven—where peace, nature, and the art of living harmonize in a place shaped by passion and purpose.

      Sixteen years ago, I traveled the jungles, mountains, and national parks of Panama for three years, camping in my hammock and voluntarily losing myself in these spaces which, from my life experience around the world, represent my cozy nest, the place where I feel comfortable and finally in complete harmony.


      So, when by the greatest of chances, coming out of the cloud forest, I discovered this place abandoned for eight years, I immediately saw there what I had always been looking for to settle down for a while and realize the most beautiful work that a man can create: an autonomous place in perfect synergy with wild nature.


      What first fascinated me was the microclimate, whose fundamental interest for a serene life I immediately perceived. Like wrapping myself in the arms of this great nature, the place was completely monastic and corresponded to this much-sought-after peace. While this peace opened up a grandiose spectacle of a view of the Baru volcano and the extraordinary dance of the clouds. The soil was virgin, ready to welcome my science and knowledge to germinate a work of life. I had just sold my latest creation in Roatan, and I had before me the time and the means; I could let my mind experiment again with the art of living.

      We believe in fostering abundance rather than entropy, a path that opens doors to understanding what we call nature. It is a contemplative gaze towards the universe, the cohesion of living beings moving towards abundance, ultimately, humus giving rise to life.


      Living immersed in nature, simplicity embraces you, and its energy is powerful. The sky fills with stars, your plate with succulent and healthy dishes, and silence becomes a song you listen to with joy.


      Sustainability for us is simply a love for life, a heightened respect amplified by consciousness, a happy responsibility that guides us forward. It is the opposite of the degradation created by the greed we sometimes pride ourselves on. Sustainability is life in all its beauty.

      Unique in the country, we have a large Macadamia plantation. The first trees were planted 12 years ago and are starting to produce. The Macadamia is a slow-growing tree, it takes 15 years to be in full production, which will last 100 years. The Macadamia allows us to have an excellent oil on-site, and with the pulp, a vegetable milk.
