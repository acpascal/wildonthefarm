      A masterpiece of synergy with nature, located just 15
      minutes from Boquete at 5905 feet elevation and nestled into the Amistad
      National Park.


      Step into the authentic heart of the Cloud
      Forest – an enchanted sanctuary where silence speaks volumes, the crisp
      altitude air invigorates , and clouds dance with the wind without
      disturbing your profound serenity.


      As Panama's first organic farm and only macadamia plantation, rooted in
      Horqueta since 2009, WILD ON THE FARM embodies over 15 years of
      innovative, environmentally harmonious cultivation in this exceptional
      setting.


      Starting in 2025, we open our doors with three beautiful and luxurious
      cabins, a host table to enjoy a cuisine signed by the scents and flavors
      of the garden, the farm and the jungle inviting you to immerse yourself in
      our unique world. Experience transformative detox stays, thrilling bird
      watching, guided cloud forest hikes, peaceful moments of reading in
      silence, or rejuvenating meditation amidst the farm's tranquility.


      Here, time takes on a different rhythm, designed for profound regeneration
      of your vitality.

      then later as a farm. Today it retains much of its original character,
      with the added distinction of offering visitors a serene getaway and
      retreat.
