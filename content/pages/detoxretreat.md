      Nestled at 1800 meters altitude, in the heart of the preserved cloud
      forest, our farm invites you to rediscover balance and vitality. Far from
      the daily hustle and bustle, our detox retreat program is a deep immersion
      in nature and well-being, drawing on the powerful virtues of the plants we
      cultivate according to organic farming principles, and the revitalizing
      benefits of a unique synergy of silence, fresh and healthy air, and
      nature.


      By participating in our retreat, you will benefit from the multiple virtues of plants from our organic agriculture and our unique environment, aiming particularly at:

      * Deep Detoxification: Our program supports the elimination of metabolic waste, toxins, and can help chelate certain heavy metals, restoring lightness and energy to your body.

      * Support for Bone Health: The exceptional mineral intake from organic nettle contributes to strengthening the bone matrix.

      * Anti-aging and Anti-inflammatory Action: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of farm plants help combat oxidative stress and can relieve joint pain.

      * Relief from Allergic Reactions: Certain nettle compounds are known for their potential to modulate the histamine response, offering natural support against allergic symptoms like hay fever.

      * General Strengthening: The entire program aims to strengthen your immune system, combat fatigue, and restore your vitality in the ideal setting of Wild on the Farm.
