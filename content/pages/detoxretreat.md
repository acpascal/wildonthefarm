    subtitle: Combining Organic Plants and Cloud Forest Nature
    text: >
      Nestled at 1800 meters altitude, in the heart of the preserved cloud
      forest, our farm invites you to rediscover balance and vitality. Far from
      the daily hustle and bustle, our detox retreat program is a deep immersion
      in nature and well-being, drawing on the powerful virtues of the plants we
      cultivate according to organic farming principles, and the revitalizing
      benefits of a unique synergy of silence, fresh and healthy air, and
      nature.


      Our detox program goes beyond simple herbal teas. It's a synergy of
      several elements for complete purification and revitalization, drawing
      from the generosity of Wild on the Farm and its environment:


      * Fresh Organic Farm Plant Cures: We use nettle and other detoxifying plants
      freshly picked on-site, from our organic farm. Their detoxifying
      properties (diuretic action, liver support, blood and lymphatic
      purification, de-acidifying action, heavy metal chelation) are optimized
      by their freshness and the purity of their cultivation.

      * Revitalizing Diet: Our meals are designed to support detoxification,
      light, nutritious, and prepared with products from our organic farm.

      * Pure Cloud Forest Air: Breathing the fresh and healthy air of our
      environment at 1800m altitude is an act of purification in itself, deeply
      oxygenating your body and mind.

      * Cloud Forest Walks: Guided walks
      in the cloud forest are not just gentle physical activity; they are an
      essential reconnection with the nature of our location, promoting
      movement, mental clarity, and elimination, while enjoying the silence and
      beauty.

      * Silence Space: The monastic side of our environment is a
      place of silence allowing you to disconnect from external and internal
      noise, facilitating introspection, stress reduction, and mental
      regeneration, an integral part of the well-being synergy at Wild on the
      Farm.

      * Restorative Sleep: The calm environment of our farm and the
      air quality of the cloud forest promote deep and restorative sleep,
      essential for the body's healing and revitalization processes.


      ** The Benefits for Your Vitality, Supported by Organic Plants and
      the Farm Environment **


      By participating in our retreat at Wild on the Farm, you will benefit from the multiple virtues of plants
      from our organic agriculture and our unique environment, aiming
      particularly at:
      *   Deep Detoxification: Our program supports the
      elimination of metabolic waste, toxins, and can help chelate certain heavy
      metals, restoring lightness and energy to your body thanks to the plants
      cultivated on site.

      *   Support for Bone Health: The exceptional
      mineral intake from organic nettle (calcium, magnesium, silicon)
      contributes to strengthening the bone matrix.

      *   Anti-aging and Anti-inflammatory Action: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
      of farm plants help combat oxidative stress and can relieve joint pain
      (arthritis, osteoarthritis), contributing to lasting well-being.

      *   Relief from Allergic Reactions: Certain nettle compounds are known for
      their potential to modulate the histamine response, offering natural
      support against allergic symptoms like hay fever.

      *   General Strengthening: The entire program (organic plants, diet, pure air, rest)
      aims to strengthen your immune system, combat fatigue, and restore your
      vitality in the ideal setting of Wild on the Farm.
