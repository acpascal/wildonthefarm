      The Enchanting Garden of the Cloud Forest


      Nestled in the heart of the cloud forest, a remarkable garden thrives,
      serving as a beacon of hope and harmony. This is no ordinary garden; it's
      a testament to the power of syntropy, illustrating an ideal connection
      with life. This garden embodies a philosophy of living in harmony with
      nature, promoting sustainability and regeneration.


      Flavors and Fragrances


      The garden offers more than just visual beauty; it is a sensory delight.
      It fills the air with enchanting fragrances, a bouquet of scents that
      tantalize and soothe. The produce from this garden enriches our kitchen,
      offering flavors that are both exquisite and nourishing. Each bite carries
      the essence of the cloud forest, a reminder of the interconnectedness of
      all living things.


      A Path of Perseverance


      This path towards abundance is marked by perseverance. It is a commitment
      to nurturing life, understanding that every element in the garden plays a
      crucial role in the ecosystem. Through careful observation and mindful
      intervention, the garden flourishes, becoming a sanctuary for both humans
      and wildlife.


      Amidst the cloud forest, the garden stands as a symbol of what can be
      achieved when we align ourselves with the rhythms of nature. It is a
      testament to the power of syntropy and a reminder that by nurturing the
      earth, we nurture ourselves. As we walk this path, we move closer to an
      ideal connection with life, rich in flavors, fragrances, and a profound
      sense of abundance.

      To the Kitchen


      I know the garden, and i love picking aromatic herbs and vegetables at all
      stages of their growth, just before cooking them, so, that all their
      fragrances exalt their freshness and vitality. From rich and living soil
      flourish vegetables full of nutrients and vitality, herbs rich in
      essential oils that nourish you deeply, offering health and, beyond that,
      the joy of living.


      My cooking finds its inspiration in the garden; it changes with the
      seasons and the weather. It is lived in the present in a spontaneous
      creation to invite you to the joy of being at the table.


      Among other things, you will love our endless salads, nettle soup,
      Tagines, pasta with fresh herb oil, melted tomatoes on a slice of grilled
      bread with garlic and parsley, and chicken with fresh vegetables and
      coconut milk. Poached eggs in a bath of fresh tomatoes and herbs with our
      homemade bacon, for a delicious breakfast. Of course, we also make our own
      jams, pestos, etc.


      I cultivate and cook for your pleasure and for your health, simply.
