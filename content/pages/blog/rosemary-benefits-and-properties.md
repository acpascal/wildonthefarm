###### Liver & Digestive Health

We often forget that **rosemary has long been used as a liver herb**.  
Classified as a _bitter aromatic_, it supports digestion by:

- Stimulating **gastric, pancreatic, and bile secretions**
- Toning smooth digestive muscles
- Acting on the **liver and gallbladder** as:
  - **Choleretic** – boosts bile production to eliminate toxins
  - **Cholagogue** – stimulates gallbladder contractions to expel thickened bile

**Key benefits:**

- Gentle depurative (supports waste elimination)
- Antispasmodic and antibacterial (relieves cramps, reduces fermentation bacteria)
- Liver protector — effective even as a simple infusion

> _Tip:_ For hepatobiliary migraines or liver stress (from rich food or alcohol), rosemary can be taken in prolonged treatment.
