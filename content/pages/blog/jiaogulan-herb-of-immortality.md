** Jiaogulan: The Herb of Immortality **

I first discovered Jiaogulan (Gynostemma pentaphyllum), a climbing herb native to Asia, while training in Taichi at a Taoist temple in China. There, this plant is traditionally used and often nicknamed the "herb of immortality". This name comes from observations of local populations, particularly in the Guizhou province, where residents who regularly consumed this plant seemed to enjoy remarkable longevity and vitality. Impressed by its potential benefits and history, I decided to cultivate it so I could share its immense adaptogenic benefits with others. Today, Jiaogulan is also gaining popularity in the West for its many beneficial properties.

** Why Jiaogulan in Our Detox Programs? **

We integrate Jiaogulan into our detoxification programs for several key reasons related to its active compounds, particularly the gypenosides. These molecules are structurally similar to the ginsenosides found in ginseng and share many of their effects.

Its Main Properties:

- ** Adaptogen: ** Jiaogulan helps the body adapt to physical, chemical, and environmental stress. It can help regulate bodily functions, promoting balance (homeostasis).

- ** Antioxidant: ** Rich in antioxidants, it helps combat free radicals, contributing to protecting cells from oxidative stress and supporting the body's natural detoxification processes.

- ** Liver Support: ** Some studies suggest that Jiaogulan may support liver function, a crucial organ in the detoxification process.

- ** Immune System Support: ** It is reputed to modulate and strengthen the immune system.

- ** General Well-being: ** It can contribute to improved energy, endurance, and sleep quality.

By supporting adaptogenic and antioxidant functions, Jiaogulan helps the body manage stress and optimize its own cleansing mechanisms, making it an excellent complement to a holistic detoxification approach. This is why we have chosen to include this precious plant in our programs.

** How we Consume Jiaogulan? **

Jiaogulan is most often consumed as a herbal tea. The dried leaves are steeped in hot water, offering a mild and slightly sweet beverage.

** Conclusion **

Jiaogulan is a remarkable plant endowed with adaptogenic and antioxidant properties that make it a valuable ally for supporting general well-being and assisting the body's natural detoxification processes.
