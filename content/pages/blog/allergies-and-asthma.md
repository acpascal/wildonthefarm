_Sometimes, nature hides miracles in plain sight. My story begins 15 years ago, in the lush Talamanca mountain range of Panama._

###### From Allergies to an Unexpected Cure

Fifteen years ago, I developed my **organic farm** in the Talamanca mountains, right on the border with Costa Rica.  
One day, while walking through the surrounding jungle, I was **severely stung by a plant**.

I had suffered from _severe allergies_ for years, making daily life miserable. Assuming it might be a plant from the nettle family, I took a risk and **consumed its seeds**.

A few months later, while traveling with my children and admiring massive blooming trees, I suddenly realized something: **my allergies were completely gone** — and they have never returned since.

###### Helping a Friend with Asthma

Back on the farm, while continuing my project, I received a visit from a friend. We went on a **jungle tour to observe Quetzals**, the iconic birds of our region.  
The high-altitude, humid air triggered an **asthma attack** for him, and he reached for his inhaler.

I told him about my experience and offered a **freshly harvested dose of the same plant’s seeds**.

His result was nothing short of astonishing: after **40 years of suffering**, and now 14 years since that day, **he has never had another asthma attack**. His asthma was gone.

###### More Success Stories

Since then, I’ve seen **several people** with allergies or asthma experience _complete relief_ after just one dose.

It turned out that:

- The plant had **no connection to the nettle family**.
- It could have been dangerous in other circumstances.
- Yet it **eradicated allergies and asthma** in everyone who tried it.

###### Hitting a Wall with Institutions

Filled with hope, I contacted a lawyer to reach out to **laboratories and organizations**.  
But there was **no interest, no reply** — nothing.

Years passed, and I came to believe that **institutions like the AAFA** are more focused on profit than on truly helping the sick.

This left me with a mix of **frustration and disappointment**.  
I wasn’t asking for money — just for the possibility to explore a natural cure.

###### A New Chapter: Our Retreats

In 2025, I completed my **Detox & Bird Watching Retreat** project, opening for the 2026 season.  
Now, I’ve decided:

> _If you come to stay with us, you will have the **freedom to choose** to try this plant, at your own risk, to potentially eliminate your asthma or allergies — permanently._

- **No monetary charge** — only a voluntary donation if you wish, and only once you are fully free of symptoms.
- **Only one dose needed** — based on all past experiences.
- **Plant is endemic** — found only in our region, mainly on our property.
- **No shipping possible** — it’s too rare and unstudied to send doses elsewhere.
