    subtitle: Hike mystical trails right from your doorstep
    text: >
      Your stay here is a moment of peace, a deep relaxation nestled within
      nature characteristic of this very region. While bars, discos, and
      restaurants abound everywhere, the true magic of the cloud forest and its
      unique universe awaits you right here, high in the mountains at Wild on
      the Farm.


      Here, you don't just go on an excursion to the cloud forest along
      organized paths; you integrate with it, day and night. You'll live its
      sounds, its ancient trees, feel the warmth of its sun, and yes, embrace
      the invigorating freshness of the 'Bajareque' mist we love so much.


      Hiking truly finds its meaning with us. Trails open up right from
      your doorstep, inviting you into immediate immersion within the forest and
      the mountain landscape. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hiker,
      a scientist or a nature lover, a photographer or simply a contemplator,
      the wild nature of La Amistad National Park will gently envelop you.


      Our paths here are not wide, cleared tracks, but gentle trails
      that keep you intimately connected with the universe you're exploring.
      It's a world abundant with vibrant mosses and intricate lichens, home to
      majestic trees reaching for the sky and dazzling bromeliads. It's alive
      with the presence of birds and a rich, though often unseen, array of
      fauna. But most wonderfully, it is a forest where, when the mists descend
      and everything becomes more mysterious and luminous, you can still catch a
      glimpse of fairies.

    text: >
      Welcome to Wild on the Farm, a sanctuary crafted for profound
      disconnection and meaningful reconnection. Here, life slows to the gentle
      rhythm of nature, inviting moments of meditation, exploration of the
      ancient forest, or the practice of yoga and Tai Chi. Above all, it is a
      haven to shed daily stress, to simply be – observing, listening, tasting;
      reawakening senses often muted in the bustle of modern life. It is a space
      for peace, for presence.


      Experience the vibrant pulse of the living world, find profound serenity,
      or embrace quietude with a book, comfortably nestled in the solitude of a
      cabin suspended above a sweeping, splendid view. These are moments of
      pure, internal happiness.


      While the heart of Wild on the Farm lies in tranquility and
      self-discovery, we understand that sometimes, your journey calls for
      curated experiences. This is the essence of our "Tailored Discovery"
      service.


      Beyond the stillness, we are dedicated to enriching your stay with bespoke
      activities and personalized services, meticulously arranged to match your
      unique desires and the interests of your companions.

      *   A gathering of three friends seeking collective well-being? We can
