    subtitle: Combining Organic Plants and Cloud Forest Nature
    text: >
      Our detox program goes beyond simple herbal teas. It's a synergy of several elements for complete purification and revitalization, drawing from the generosity of Wild on the Farm and its environment:
      <br><br>
      Fresh Organic Farm Plant Cures: We use nettle and other detoxifying plants freshly picked on-site, from our organic farm. Their detoxifying properties (diuretic action, liver support, blood and lymphatic purification, de-acidifying action, heavy metal chelation) are optimized by their freshness and the purity of their cultivation.
      <br><br>
      Revitalizing Diet: Our meals are designed to support detoxification, light, nutritious, and prepared with products from our organic farm.
      <br><br>
      Pure Cloud Forest Air: Breathing the fresh and healthy air of our environment at 1800m altitude is an act of purification in itself, deeply oxygenating your body and mind.
      <br><br>
      Cloud Forest Walks: Guided walks in the cloud forest are not just gentle physical activity; they are an essential reconnection with the nature of our location, promoting movement, mental clarity, and elimination, while enjoying the silence and beauty.
      <br><br>
      Silence Space: The monastic side of our environment is a place of silence allowing you to disconnect from external and internal noise, facilitating introspection, stress reduction, and mental regeneration, an integral part of the well-being synergy at Wild on the Farm.
      <br><br>
      Restorative Sleep: The calm environment of our farm and the air quality of the cloud forest promote deep and restorative sleep, essential for the body's healing and revitalization processes.
      <br><br>
      <strong>The Benefits for Your Vitality, Supported by Organic Plants and the Farm Environment</strong>
      <br><br>
      By participating in our retreat at Wild on the Farm, you will benefit from the multiple virtues of plants from our organic agriculture and our unique environment, aiming particularly at:
      <br><br>
      Deep Detoxification: Our program supports the elimination of metabolic waste, toxins, and can help chelate certain heavy metals, restoring lightness and energy to your body thanks to the plants cultivated on site.
      <br><br>
      Support for Bone Health: The exceptional mineral intake from organic nettle (calcium, magnesium, silicon) contributes to strengthening the bone matrix.
      <br><br>
      Anti-aging and Anti-inflammatory Action: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of farm plants help combat oxidative stress and can relieve joint pain (arthritis, osteoarthritis), contributing to lasting well-being.
      <br><br>
      Relief from Allergic Reactions: Certain nettle compounds are known for their potential to modulate the histamine response, offering natural support against allergic symptoms like hay fever.
      <br><br>
      General Strengthening: The entire program (organic plants, diet, pure air, rest) aims to strengthen your immune system, combat fatigue, and restore your vitality in the ideal setting of Wild on the Farm.
      <br><br>
