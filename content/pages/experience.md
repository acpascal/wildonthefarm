    text: >
      Your stay here is a moment of peace, a deep relaxation nestled within
      nature characteristic of this very region. While bars, discos, and
      restaurants abound everywhere, the true magic of the cloud forest and its
      unique universe awaits you right here, high in the mountains at Wild on
      the Farm.


      Here, you don't just go on an excursion to the cloud forest along
      organized paths; you integrate with it, day and night. You'll live its
      sounds, its ancient trees, feel the warmth of its sun, and yes, embrace
      the invigorating freshness of the 'Bajareque' mist we love so much.


      Hiking truly finds its meaning with us. Trails open up right from
      your doorstep, inviting you into immediate immersion within the forest and
      the mountain landscape. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced hiker,
      a scientist or a nature lover, a photographer or simply a contemplator,
      the wild nature of La Amistad National Park will gently envelop you.


      Our paths here are not wide, cleared tracks, but gentle trails
      that keep you intimately connected with the universe you're exploring.
      It's a world abundant with vibrant mosses and intricate lichens, home to
      majestic trees reaching for the sky and dazzling bromeliads. It's alive
      with the presence of birds and a rich, though often unseen, array of
      fauna. But most wonderfully, it is a forest where, when the mists descend
      and everything becomes more mysterious and luminous, you can still catch a
      glimpse of fairies.

    subtitle: Combining Organic Plants and Cloud Forest Nature
    text: >
      Nestled at 1800 meters altitude, in the heart of the preserved cloud
      forest, our farm invites you to rediscover balance and vitality. Far from
      the daily hustle and bustle, our detox retreat program is a deep immersion
      in nature and well-being, drawing on the powerful virtues of the plants we
      cultivate according to organic farming principles, and the revitalizing
      benefits of a unique synergy of silence, fresh and healthy air, and
      nature.


      Our detox program goes beyond simple herbal teas. It's a synergy of
      several elements for complete purification and revitalization, drawing
      from the generosity of Wild on the Farm and its environment:


      * Fresh Organic Farm Plant Cures: We use nettle and other detoxifying plants
      freshly picked on-site, from our organic farm. Their detoxifying
      properties (diuretic action, liver support, blood and lymphatic
      purification, de-acidifying action, heavy metal chelation) are optimized
      by their freshness and the purity of their cultivation.

      * Revitalizing Diet: Our meals are designed to support detoxification,
      light, nutritious, and prepared with products from our organic farm.
      * Pure Cloud Forest Air: Breathing the fresh and healthy air of our
      environment at 1800m altitude is an act of purification in itself, deeply
      oxygenating your body and mind.

      * Cloud Forest Walks: Guided walks
      in the cloud forest are not just gentle physical activity; they are an
      essential reconnection with the nature of our location, promoting
      movement, mental clarity, and elimination, while enjoying the silence and
      beauty.

      * Silence Space: The monastic side of our environment is a
      place of silence allowing you to disconnect from external and internal
      noise, facilitating introspection, stress reduction, and mental
      regeneration, an integral part of the well-being synergy at Wild on the
      Farm.

      * Restorative Sleep: The calm environment of our farm and the
      air quality of the cloud forest promote deep and restorative sleep,
      essential for the body's healing and revitalization processes.


      ** The Benefits for Your Vitality, Supported by Organic Plants and
      the Farm Environment **


      By participating in our retreat at Wild on the Farm, you will benefit from the multiple virtues of plants
      from our organic agriculture and our unique environment, aiming
      particularly at:
      *   Deep Detoxification: Our program supports the
      elimination of metabolic waste, toxins, and can help chelate certain heavy
      metals, restoring lightness and energy to your body thanks to the plants
      cultivated on site.

      *   Support for Bone Health: The exceptional
      mineral intake from organic nettle (calcium, magnesium, silicon)
      contributes to strengthening the bone matrix.

      *   Anti-aging and Anti-inflammatory Action: The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties
      of farm plants help combat oxidative stress and can relieve joint pain
      (arthritis, osteoarthritis), contributing to lasting well-being.

      *   Relief from Allergic Reactions: Certain nettle compounds are known for
      their potential to modulate the histamine response, offering natural
      support against allergic symptoms like hay fever.

      *   General Strengthening: The entire program (organic plants, diet, pure air, rest)
      aims to strengthen your immune system, combat fatigue, and restore your
      vitality in the ideal setting of Wild on the Farm.

    text: >
      Welcome to Wild on the Farm, a sanctuary crafted for profound
      disconnection and meaningful reconnection. Here, life slows to the gentle
      rhythm of nature, inviting moments of meditation, exploration of the
      ancient forest, or the practice of yoga and Tai Chi. Above all, it is a
      haven to shed daily stress, to simply be – observing, listening, tasting;
      reawakening senses often muted in the bustle of modern life. It is a space
      for peace, for presence.


      Experience the vibrant pulse of the living world, find profound serenity,
      or embrace quietude with a book, comfortably nestled in the solitude of a
      cabin suspended above a sweeping, splendid view. These are moments of
      pure, internal happiness.


      While the heart of Wild on the Farm lies in tranquility and
