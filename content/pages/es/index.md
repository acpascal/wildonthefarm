      A masterpiece of synergy with nature, located just 15 minutes from Boquete
      at 5905 feet elevation and nestled into the Amistad National Park.

      where silence speaks volumes, the crisp altitude air invigorates , and
      clouds dance with the wind without disturbing your profound serenity.


      As Panama's first organic farm and only macadamia plantation, rooted in
      Horqueta since 2009, WILD ON THE FARM embodies over 15 years of
      innovative, environmentally harmonious cultivation in this exceptional
      setting.


      Starting in 2025, we open our doors with three beautiful and luxurious
      cabins, a host table to enjoy a cuisine signed by the scents and flavors
      of the garden, the farm and the jungle inviting you to immerse yourself in
      our unique world. Experience transformative detox stays, thrilling bird
      watching, guided cloud forest hikes, peaceful moments of reading in
      silence, or rejuvenating meditation amidst the farm's tranquility.


      Here, time takes on a different rhythm, designed for profound regeneration
      of your vitality.
