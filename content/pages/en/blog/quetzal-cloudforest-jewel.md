_A magnificent bird, a symbol of freedom for the Mayans and an icon of our highland forests._

###### A Sacred Symbol

The **Resplendent Quetzal** has long been revered.  
For the ancient Mayans, it symbolized **freedom**, for it is said to die if confined in captivity.  
It was also a **symbol of wealth and power** — its vibrant feathers were once used as currency and royal ornamentation.

My fascination with this bird began in the early 1980s, when I lived with the **Kaqchikel people** on the shores of Lake Atitlán in Guatemala.  
Today, it is part of my daily life in the **Talamanca mountain range**, where I’ve lived for the past 18 years in its beloved cloud forest habitat.

###### Daily Encounters

From my terrace, I often watch the quetzal’s **chaotic, fluttering flight** in the early mornings and evenings as it searches for the seeds of the **White Cigua tree** it loves.

Sometimes it lands on the cedar tree overlooking my home, calling out with its **distinctive rallying cry** or giving the short, chattering cackle that signals it’s about to take flight.

Its song resonates through the **La Amistad National Park** forest that surrounds the farm — a soundtrack to the magic of the cloud forest.

###### Breeding Season

In **February**, the quetzals arrive to reunite with their mates or form new pairs.  
We hike up to the ridges to observe them. They are not shy — in fact, they are curious, often gathering in groups before searching for a **rotting tree hollow** to prepare as a nest.

- The female lays **two eggs**
- Both parents share incubation duties:
  - Male during the day
  - Female at night
- Incubation lasts **17–19 days**
- They defend their territory with a distinctive **two-part call**

The parents work as a team to guard the chicks against predators such as **snakes, toucans, and raptors**. I have even seen them help a fallen chick climb back to the nest.

Their diet here at **Wild on the Farm** includes:

- Seeds of Lauraceae species such as white Cigua
- Bambito seeds
- Wild avocado
- Occasionally, insects

###### Fledging and Migration

At around **five months old**, the young quetzals learn to fly and find food.  
This stage is noisy and active, as families form **large, vocal groups**. It’s one of my favorite times to observe them.

When the food supply in the highlands is depleted, they migrate together to **lower elevations** in search of new resources.

Here in our mountains, we are privileged to host them for **six to seven months** each year. Then comes the quiet season — waiting for their return, their vibrant colors, and their enchanting songs to fill the forest once again.
